## Bio
My name is John Conwell, but I've also gone by "turbo" professionally for the past 20 years. 

I'm a data scientist focused on utilizing data analysis and machine learning to identify phish and malware activity in North/South network traffic and their associated internet infrastructure. I've been exploring this intersection of machine learning and cyber security since 2017 and feel like I've found my calling. I believe that data science isn’t just about data and algorithms, but requires you to understand and empathize with your users; their needs, goals, values, and fears. This is especially true in cyber security where the cost of bad threat predictions could be devastating.

I have a diverse set of experiences, inlucding software engineering, performance tuning, data visulaization, entrepreneurship, and business. This has given me a well-rounded perspective that I bring to every aspect of my job. I try to balance the needs of the project, the customer, and the business equally to ensure my projects are successful.

When not honing my InfoSec and Machine Learning chops I also grow around 20 varieties of habaneros each year, make my own hot sauces, and fly First Person View (FPV) drones.

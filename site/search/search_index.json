I've been exploring this intersection of machine learning and cyber security since 2017 and feel like I've found my calling. I believe that data science isn\u2019t just about data and algorithms, but requires you to understand and empathize with your users; their needs, goals, values, and fears. This is especially true in cyber security where the cost of bad threat predictions could be devastating.</p> <p>I have a diverse set of experiences, including software engineering, performance tuning, data visualization, entrepreneurship, and business. This has given me a well-rounded perspective that I bring to every aspect of my job. I try to balance the needs of the project, the customer, and the business equally to ensure my projects are successful.</p> <p>When not honing my InfoSec and Machine Learning chops I also grow around 20 varieties of habaneros each year, make my own hot sauces, and fly First Person View (FPV) drones.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Mastadon</li> <li>Twitter</li> <li>GitHub</li> <li>LinkedIn</li> <li>Keybase</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#open-source-projects","title":"Open Source Projects","text":""},{"location":"index.html#secret-handshake","title":"Secret Handshake","text":"<p>A prototype malware C2 channel using x509 certificates to hold the data payloads over mTLS</p>"},{"location":"index.html#fqdn-parser","title":"FQDN Parser","text":"<p>FQDN Parser (Fully Qualified Domain Name Parser) is a library used to parse FQDNs into their component parts, including subdomains, domain names, and their Public Suffix.</p> <p>It also provides additional contextual metadata about the domain's TLD including:</p> <ul> <li>International TLDs in both unicode and puny code format</li> <li>The TLD type: generic, generic-restricted, country-code, sponsored, test, infrastructure, and host_suffix (.onion)</li> <li>The date the TLD was registered with ICANN</li> <li>In the case of multi-label effective TLDs, is it public like :code:<code>.co.uk</code> which is owned by a Registrar or private like :code:<code>.duckdns.org</code> which is owned by a private company</li> <li>If the TLD (or any label in the FQDN) is puny code encoded, the ascii'ification of the unicode.

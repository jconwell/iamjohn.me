I've been exploring this intersection of machine learning and cyber security since 2017 and feel like I've found my calling. I believe that data science isn\u2019t just about data and algorithms, but requires you to understand and empathize with your users; their needs, goals, values, and fears. This is especially true in cyber security where the cost of bad threat predictions could be devastating.</p> <p>I have a diverse set of experiences, inlucding software engineering, performance tuning, data visulaization, entrepreneurship, and business. This has given me a well-rounded perspective that I bring to every aspect of my job. I try to balance the needs of the project, the customer, and the business equally to ensure my projects are successful.</p> <p>When not honing my InfoSec and Machine Learning chops I also grow around 20 varieties of habaneros each year, make my own hot sauces, and fly First Person View (FPV) drones.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Mastadon</li> <li>Twitter</li> <li>GitHub</li> <li>LinkedIn</li> <li>Keybase</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#projects","title":"Projects","text":""},{"location":"index.html#secret-handshake","title":"Secret Handshake","text":"<p>A prototype malware C2 channel using x509 certificates over mTLS</p>"},{"location":"index.html#publications-articles","title":"Publications &amp; Articles","text":"<ul> <li>An OSINT Analysis of x509 Certificates, Part One - 2022</li> <li>An OSINT Analysis of x509 Certificates, Part Two - 2022</li> <li>\u2018Deepfake\u2019 videos: to believe or not believe? - 2021</li> <li>Intelligence-Sharing in Action: COVID-19 Cyber Threat Coalition - 2020</li> <li>Security Rift - 2020</li> <li>Privacy advocates fight back after China tightens surveillance controls - 2020</li> <li>Krebs on Security - Sipping from the Coronavirus Domain Firehose - 2020</li> <li>A year of deepfakes and deep deception - 2020</li> </ul>"}]}
